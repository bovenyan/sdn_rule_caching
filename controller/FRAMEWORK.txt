RuleParsing:
	parsing rules into terms and store it:
	Rule_Parsing(file_name)

QuadTree Construction:
	Check what rules are in a certain cut space;
	Space_matching(cut_space, parsed_rule)

	Do cut and find a most balanced cut
	Do_cut(cut_node)
		balance_idx = Space_matching(cut_space, parsed_rule)
		check the feasibility of the cut, this cut reduce the overlapp
